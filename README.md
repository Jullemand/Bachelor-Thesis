# Bachelor Thesis (Data Science and Economics)
This is Julian Valdman's Bachelor Thesis spring 2022

## Thesis Information

**Major**: Data Science and Economics
**Title**: Semi- and nonparametric estimation of price dispersion and auction heterogeneity with eBay auctions

## Table of Content of the Report

(1) Introduction
(2) The eBay marketplace and data
(3) Maximum Likelihood Estimation
(4) Artificial Neural Networks and Multi-class classfication
(5) Discussion and Conclusion

## Methods
The analysis comprises 2 different methods of price analysis:

* Maximum Likelihood with **Hermite Series**: Using flexible polynomial to estimate density distribution of prices
* Artificial Neural Network (ANN): Using non-parametric deep learning model to exhaust predictive power of the auction attributes

## Conclusions
From the analysis and including microeconomic theory, the report concludes:

* Some price dispersion can be explained by auction heterogeneity
* Most auction features have smaller economic effect on end price
* Most of the auction feature effects are aligned with economic theory and similar analysis
